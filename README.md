# Assembler-console-emulation

Assembler language emulation that parses txt file in a given format and produces basic operations to get the wanted result.
It parses single-address assembler code, with raw input commands (it doesn't use special version of assembler, just general variation of assembler).
It can be modified to parse any kind of assembler code.

The code that checks the parity of a number is given as an example in a form of a txt file.

Note: Names of folders and even code variables are often written in Bosnian.
